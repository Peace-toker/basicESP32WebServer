Requires latest "esp32 board from Espressif" in arduino board manager

Onboard LED is controlled from analogWrite line. 0 is off. 255 is max (Will likely damage board and produce massive heat at higher levels. Do not overload)

Made using Microsoft Copilot. Pin assignments are based on https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P2578LV or equivalent cheap cam board

can adjust jpeg quality value for better picture or faster stream as well, changing FRAMESIZE to other accepted values should result in higher resolution.
